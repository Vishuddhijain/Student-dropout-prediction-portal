## 📌 Overview

Student dropout is a major challenge faced by higher education institutions, often leading to academic, financial, and social consequences.  
The **Student Dropout Prediction Portal** leverages **Machine Learning**, **Explainable AI (XAI)**, and **Generative AI** to assist institutions in identifying at-risk students early and supporting timely intervention.

The system not only predicts dropout probability but also explains *why* a student is at risk, enabling educators and counsellors to make informed, ethical, and data-driven decisions.

## 📈 Risk Interpretation

| Risk Level | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|
| Low | Student is academically stable |
| Medium | Monitoring and guidance advised |
| High | Counselling intervention recommended |
| Extreme | Immediate academic intervention required |

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Cross-model consistency testing
- API and UI integration testing
- Edge-case handling for incomplete or extreme inputs

---

## ⚖️ Ethical AI Considerations

- Transparent and interpretable predictions
- No automated enforcement of decisions
- Designed to assist educators, not replace human judgement
- Responsible use of student data
